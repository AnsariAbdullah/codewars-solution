# Info

Add maps and set in JS. Not sure if this should go in global readme. Also add looping of `for of` and `for in`.

Maybe you can write a blog about the journey of codewars on hashnode.

Differet types of `for loop` uses:
- `for of` for array
- `for in` for object

### Start the freecodecamp JS section and write those as well in the main readme section.
- Make it a point based thing
- Add sections eg. all `Math.` methods go together
- Create an index for all the links

Note: Format the actual readme in a better way [AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

- Add prettier for formatting code is also important
- Configure prettier as well
- Minor changes

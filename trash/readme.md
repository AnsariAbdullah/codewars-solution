This is a trash file.
Add maps and set in JS. Not sure if this should go in global readme. Also add looping of `for of` and `for in`.

Maybe you can write a blog about the journey of codewars on hashnode. Hashnode is better because Quency Larson recommends it saying it is fast and easy.

Differet types of `for loop` uses:
- `for of` for array
- `for in` for object

Do other challenges as well from the link above. Find other links also. If there are more challenges like Hackereart... create a new folder for it and store it's solution there.

### Start the freecodecamp JS section and write those as well in the main readme section.
- Make it a point based thing
- Add sections eg. all `Math.` methods go together

Note: Format the actual readme in a better way (Like AirBNB documentation)
Link for reference: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

Later on format all docs as well

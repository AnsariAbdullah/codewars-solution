Add maps and set in JS. Not sure if this should go in global readme. Also add looping of `for of` and `for in`.

Maybe you can write a blog about the journey of codewars on hashnode.

Differet types of `for loop` uses:
- `for of` for array
- `for in` for object

### Start the freecodecamp JS section and write those as well in the main readme section.
- Make it a point based thing
- Add sections eg. all `Math.` methods go together
- Create an index for all the links

Note: Format the actual readme in a better way [AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

Note: Add typescript solutions as well

Add a sub folder in codewars with all JS tutorial questions in it and number it.

Add JS methods in order. And add a list to navigate it.

## Array
## array.map()
map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. It does not execute the function for empty elements. It does not change the original array.

## array.filter
The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function. This method does not execute the function for empty elements. The method does not change the original array.

## array.find
The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. It method executes a function for each array element and returns undefined if no elements are found. It does not execute the function for empty elements. It does not change the original array.

# String
## string.trim()
The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string. It does not change the original string.

## toUpperCase()
The toUpperCase() method converts a string to uppercase letters. This method does not change the original string.

This is a trash file.
Add maps and set in JS. Not sure if this should go in global readme. Also add looping of `for of` and `for in`.

Maybe you can write a blog about the journey of codewars on hashnode. Hashnode is better because Quency Larson recommends it saying it is fast and easy.

Differet types of `for loop` uses:
- `for of` for array
- `for in` for object

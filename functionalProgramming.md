## About functional programming
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: `INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT`

Functional programming is about:

<ol>
  <li>Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that subject to change</li>
  <li>Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output</li>
  <li>Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled</li>
</ol>

## This readme file is a collection of all the things I learned during solving codewars Katas

- With time this file will be populated and edited.
- It might also have some code snippets for examples


### forEach
- Iterates over array and modifies new array

### map
- Iterates over array and modifies the same array

### slice()
- Returns selected elements in an array, as a new array. It selects from a given start, up to a (not inclusive) given end.

### splice()
- Method adds and/or removes array elements. It overwrites the original array

### Math.max
- Returns largest value given as input parameters. 
eg. Math.max(1, 2, 3) // will return 3
- This will also work on arrays
eg. Math.max(...array) // will return largest value from array

### Math.min
- Returns smallest value given as input parameters. 
eg. Math.min(1, 2, 3) // will return 1
- This will also work on arrays
eg. Math.min(...array) // will return smallest value from array

## Escaping literal quote
Placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote will help to escape literal quote

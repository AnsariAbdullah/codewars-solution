Your task is to make function, which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.

The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: begin, end, step (inclusive).

If begin value is greater than the end, function should returns 0

Examples

2,2,2 --> 2
2,6,2 --> 12 (2 + 4 + 6)
1,5,1 --> 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
1,5,3  --> 5 (1 + 4)

## Solution
The functon runs only when the value of end is greater than value of begin.

a for loop runs that starts from the begin value and end when the value is less than or equal to end. The increament counter incremnets on the basis of steps.

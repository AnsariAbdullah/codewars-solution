Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.

a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.

The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

A few examples:(Input1, Input2, Input3 --> Output)

## Solution
To solve this I have use switch case operator.

It takes the operator parameter and performs operation based on that and returns the value.

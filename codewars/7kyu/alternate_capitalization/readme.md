Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index `0` will be considered even.

For example, `capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']`. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

Good luck!

## Solution
Create a variable and convert it into small case and run loop on on it. On each itiration check if the index is odd or even based on that capitilize the word and add it or don't capitalize.

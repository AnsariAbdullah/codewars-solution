0 or more Integers. If both arr1 and arr2 are empty, then just return an empty array.

Note: arr1 and arr2 may be sorted in different orders. Also arr1 and arr2 may have same integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.

Examples (input -> output)
* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

* [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

* [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12]

## Solution
Merge arrays. Sort them in ascending order. Run a loop to check if the resultant array has duplicate values - remove duplicates and push into new array. Return new array.

Write function heron which calculates the area of a triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and `c` (`x`, `y`, `z` in COBOL).

Heron's formula: Square root of `s∗(s−a)∗(s−b)∗(s−c)`
​where: `s= (a+b+c)/2`
​
Notes
- All inputs are valid triangles with integer sides.
- You do not need to round anything. Answers will be tested for correctness within a margin of 0.01.

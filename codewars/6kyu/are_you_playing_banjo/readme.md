Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"

## Solution
check if the first letter of the string passed in fucntion is 'R' of 'r'. If true return 'plays bajo' else return 'does not play banjo'
